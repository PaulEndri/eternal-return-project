## Introduction
This project is my attempt at working with monorepo principles to create a usable UI, SDK, backend APi (Eventually) and any needed utilities. Each project has it's own directory and any dependencies are treated as local NPM Dependencies

## Sections
### SDK
Where all interfaces, constants, and general class constructs are housed

### Scraper
A quick and dirty scraper to get game data from the official wiki

### UI
React based UI

### Playground
Misc. playground for testing and more
